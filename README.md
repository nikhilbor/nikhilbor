Hi, I'm Nikhil 👋
I work at the intersection of Cybersecurity and Machine Learning, building models for threat detection, fraud monitoring, and anomaly detection.

💼 Experience: Data Protection , Security Analyst, ML projects across fraud, DDoS, and cyber logs
🧠 Focus: UEBA-style anomaly detection, fraud model drift, threat detection on logs
🛠 Tech: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Splunk, Imperva DSF, Azure
🔐 ML + Security Projects
Cyber Threat Detection with Deep Learning (PyTorch)
Binary classifier on cyber logs (BETH dataset) using a feedforward network with weighted loss. Achieved ~0.969 F1 on a heavily imbalanced dataset.

Fraud Model Monitoring & Drift Analysis
Production-style fraud model diagnostics using CBPE and drift metrics to detect performance degradation and feature drift, with clear business impact narrative.

Financial Chatbot (BCG Simulation)
Data cleaning + analysis on financial datasets and a rule-based NLP chatbot (NLTK) to answer business queries from structured data.

Customer Churn Optimization (BCG DS Simulation)
Fixed a useless model (5.5% recall) by focusing on class imbalance and threshold tuning, increasing recall to ~38% for at-risk customers.

Green Vancouver – Tree Species Visualization
Altair-based EDA and visualization on Vancouver’s street trees, focusing on neighborhood biodiversity and geospatial patterns.

MonReader – Page Flip Detection (CNN)
CNN model to detect page flips from images (92% accuracy, 93% F1), supporting an accessibility-focused document scanning workflow.

🎯 What I'm Looking For
Roles where I can apply ML to Security, including:

Security Data Scientist / ML Engineer for Threat Detection
Detection Engineering with ML (UEBA, anomaly, fraud, DDoS)
AI Security / ML for Security Analytics
